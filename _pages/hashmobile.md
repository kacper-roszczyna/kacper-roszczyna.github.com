# About the Company

# About the Role
Developer at Vidicom on Hashmobile Project

The role sounds generic and it was. To put it simply I had to be the jack of all trades. My responsibilities included maintaining and developing a Java EE monolythic backend solution, as well as modernizing the iOS application written in Objective-C under the guidance of a senior colleague. 

# Projects Overview and Technical Challenges
The project was a Quality Assurance application which enabled creating flexible reporting templates, filling them in, scheduling them, and rendering pdfs. It also provided an overview of reporting within your company. It was a multitenant solution, which could additionally be deployed on the client's infrastructure on requrest. 

My core responsibility was maintaining and developing new features within the Java EE monolythic application, as well as running its operations. 

My secondary responsibility was refactoring the PDF rendering functionality within the iOS application written in Objective-C, and provide a new pdf output format. 

The main technical challenge was the inherited code quality. With classes frequently spanning 1000 lines, almost complete lack of object programming paradigm despite using object oriented objects by default.
