# About the Role
Tech Lead at Immotef on Multiple Research Projects for Cordeel

My job was to research new technologies that could aid in solving problems Cordeel encountered during the process of production of building elements, their assembly and care. I led a team of developers from project concept, through research to PoC phase and then aided the client in evaluating the usefulness. 

# Projects Overview and Technical Challenges
## Inspector
We attempted to leverage Hololens technology and later Apple device depth sensors to overlay 3D models of prefabricated structural elements onto real assemblies to detect QA issues during the build. To achieve this we leveraged the IFC standard and the Unity Games Engine. 

In the end the project was discarded as we could not achieve locking the 3D model in place properly. It's worth noting that this was back in 2014, when AR and VR technology was more of a novelty than now. 

My role included routine travel to meet the client, test the system on site, gather the client's feedback. Inspector's job was also to provide a paper-free tracking system for their assemblies and tracking each element from design to fabrication and shipping. This part of the solution was successfully implemented, and was met with acceptance and productionized. 

## Mapper
We developed a solution which took whole rooms and displayed them in Microsoft's Hololens, so that the user could inspect the structural elements' assembly. This was mainly used to check piping and electrical. While we sucessfully built a PoC solution it suffered from the same issues as Inspector and in the end was discarded.
