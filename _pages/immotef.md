# About the Company
Immotef was once a company that hoped to become the next Poland based unicorn utilizing AR and VR to disrupt the construction industry. Later it transitioned into becoming a software house, to finally close its doors. 

# About the Role
I spent over 5 years at Immotef and its other linked companies. 

Starting as an Android Developer, and later transitioning into backend development over the years I built a team of up to ten reports at the company's peak. At the time I managed the development of over 7 projects at the same time, cooperated with clients, coordinated development and delivery, budgeted the projects, and supported the customers after the delivery. 

# Projects Overview and Technical Challenges
Most of the projects are detailed out in their own relevant sections depending on the company that was cooperated with. There were other smaller projects I took part in. However I wanted to use this section to describe the process of Immotef, as a software house and my part in it. It's something not described in other projects and might shed some light on how a high-pressure software building environment works. 

Each project would start with a discussion with the client - a client could be anyone, from a single person to a company. My role in that conversation was to listen, and ask questions which allowed us to construct a shared language. From the outset I tried building a vocabulary base which facilitated communicating with the client in a conscience manner. As a result I was able to frequently leave these conversations with a good chunk of functional requirements already written down. 

These functional requirements would be shared with two developers and a designer. Similar to how 37 Signals operate they would be given autonomy over the architecture, tools and frameworks, though we usually stuck to a React + Spring Java. The designer would put together wireframes and the developers would breakdown the functional requirements into tasks which could be estimated based on our experience with previous solutions built. On some projects I was one such developer. 

Once we had a rough estimate, and a general idea of the technical solution we would review it with at least one other senior member of the team. And then put these through to the Project Manager. My responsibility was to review the estimates, the work breakdown, and validate all technical solutions produced by the web team. My other responsibility was assuring we have enough manpower to run all the active development projects, create development plans for personel, advise them on what to study, or which skills they need to improve on. There isn't much space for that in software houses but I did my best. 

Subsequently it was my responsibility to ensure the project's success, to gather feedback from client demos and implement improvements in an Agile manner without breaking the budget in the process. 

At its peak I was managing 7 different projects at the same time and a team of 10 developers.
